# lg-7 — Import the workbook's history since 2022, verified before it is written

## Why

The owner chose to import all of the history. The workbook is internally
consistent, but it carries a known set of typing errors and two historical
settlement formulas ([00-ANALYSIS.md §8](../00-ANALYSIS.md)). The import has to
prove it reproduces the workbook's own figures before it writes a row.

## Build

1. **A command, not a route.** `npm run import:ledger -- <workbook.xlsx>
[--corrections <file.json>]`, in `api`, writing to the configured database.
   It is a one-off, and it has no reason to exist on the network.
2. **Reading `.xlsx`:**
   - use cached cell values, never evaluated formulas;
   - prefer `exceljs`;
   - **do not use the `xlsx` package from npm.** Its registry copy is stale and
     carries known advisories, and SheetJS publishes fixes only off-registry.
   - `books` receives plain cell grids and stays pure.
3. **Year sheets** (`2022` … `2026`), per the layout in §8 of the analysis:
   - the year comes from the sheet name, and a date whose year disagrees is
     repaired and reported;
   - rows with no amount are skipped;
   - an empty person means joint;
   - notes land on the row;
   - `Solde reporté` rows are verified against the previous year's closing
     balance and are not imported as movements.
4. **Rows go in as statement rows** with their classification already attached,
   marked as imported rather than pasted. Where a pasted row covers the same
   day, the two must agree.
5. **Period sheets** become closed periods, each with its lines and its recorded
   settlement **as it actually happened**. Their formula version is `v1` or
   `v2`, told apart by the formula text in the `Montant à déposer` cell. The open
   period comes in open.
6. **The `Accueil` salaries** become the first salary records, and the first
   ratio.
7. **Corrections file:** owner decisions such as "this row belongs in the other
   bucket". It is JSON, it lives **outside the repository**, and each correction
   lands with a note on its row.
8. **The report**, printed before anything is written:
   - counts of rows imported, repaired, skipped and corrected;
   - the mortgage gap and the cumulative catch-up, each beside the figure the
     workbook shows;
   - a nonzero exit when a verification fails.
     `--write` performs the import; without it, the command is a dry run.

**Fixture:** a synthetic workbook built by the test, never a copy of the real
one. It needs a typo'd year, a placeholder row, a joint row, a carry-over, a v1
period and a v2 period.

## Done when

1. The dry run on the synthetic workbook reports every repair and writes
   nothing. A test asserts the database is unchanged.
2. A carry-over that disagrees with the previous year fails the import, with a
   nonzero exit.
3. `--write` reproduces the synthetic workbook's mortgage gap and buffer balance
   exactly.
4. A correction moves its row and leaves a note on it.
5. Imported period settlements keep their historical amounts and their formula
   version.
6. Gates green.
